# Scenario

A typical scenario would follow these steps:
Enter username or email: *enter the email associated with taiga account*
Password: *enter password*

If the login is successful,
Enter the project slug: *enter the name of the project along with taiga account name*

The project slug you can get from your project URL. For example, if I am looking at my Backlog on the sample board
https://tree.taiga.io/project/kgary-1-sample-scrum/backlog

The project slug is kgary-1-sample-scrum
