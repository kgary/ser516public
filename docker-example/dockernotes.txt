Commands: - docker <command> --help on anything
CONTAINER commands start with "docker container"
- "run --publish <hostport>:<containerport> --name <myname> --detach <image>"
  -> if <image> is cached locally, it is used, else it is fetched from DockerHub
  -> A new container is created by instantiating the image
- docker container run -it ... <-- -i is mapping STDIN to your terminal, -t is tty
- docker container exec -it <container id> <command>  <-- can you bash here to get into
- docker container ls [-a]
  -> lists all running containers (-a or --all shows all)
- docker [container] ps shows the same thing as docker container ls
- docker container start/stop starts/stops containers that already exist & from the state you left them in
  - -ai on start makes it so you pick up where you left off in an interactive shell
- docker container rm [-f] -> removes a container
- docker container logs <container id or name>


Example mysql: docker container run -d -p 3306:3306 --name mysqldb -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes mysql
-> Look in logs for GENERATED ROOT PASSWORD

docker image tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:tag] TARGET_IMAGE[:tag]
docker image push <repository>
